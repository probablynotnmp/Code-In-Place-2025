# 🎯 Prime Number Guessing Game  
*A fun, beginner-friendly and a very simple Python project made during Code in Place!*

## 👋 About Me

Hi there! I'm **Prathyush N M**, a curious and passionate beginner in programming. I come from a background of curiosity more than code, and that’s exactly why **Code in Place** felt like the perfect starting point for me. I joined this program hoping to learn the basics of Python, understand how real developers think, and most importantly—find joy in solving problems with code.

And honestly? It has been a **wholesome, eye-opening journey**. Every lesson, every breakout room, every tiny success felt like magic unfolding on the screen.

## 🧠 My Code in Place Experience

From the very first “Hello, world!” to building this final project, Code in Place has been a rollercoaster of learning and fun. Here's what stood out to me:

### ✨ The Structure
- **Engaging Lectures**: Taught with clarity and kindness.
- **Breakout Sections**: We got to discuss, debug, and sometimes just laugh with other learners and our section leaders. That connection made all the difference.
- **Hands-on Coding**: Practising what we learned right away helped lock it in.

### 💬 Community
Whether it was asking questions or helping others in the forum, the sense of support was always strong. Being part of a group where everyone was growing together made me feel less alone in the struggle and more excited for the journey ahead.

## 💡 The Final Project: Prime Number Guessing Game

For my final project, I wanted something simple yet surprisingly engaging. So I created this:

### 🎮 What it Does
- Picks a **random prime number** between 1 and 100.
- You get **7 chances** to guess it.
- Gives helpful clues:
  - Too high?
  - Too low?
  - Not even a prime?
- Keeps track of your guesses.
- Ends with a fun fact about primes.
- Lets you play again if you want to!

### ✅ Why This Project?
I chose this idea because:
- It’s short and sweet (~50 lines of code).
- It uses all the core concepts I’ve learned:
  - **Functions**
  - **Loops**
  - **Conditionals**
  - **Lists**
  - **Error Handling**
- And best of all—it's actually **fun to play**. Whether you love math or not, trying to guess a secret prime is oddly addictive!

### 📁 How to Run
Just open your terminal and run:

## ❤️ Final Thoughts

Before Code in Place, I wasn’t sure where or how to begin. But now I’ve written my own Python project, understood concepts that once felt scary, and discovered a love for programming I didn’t know I had.

Thank you to the **Code in Place team**, the section leaders, and every single person who made this space so beginner-friendly. This is just the beginning!

## 🪄 Bonus: Why This Game Might Make You Smile
- It’s an actual game. Not just a print statement!
- Teaches about **prime numbers** in a friendly way.
- Makes your brain work a little.
- Lets you feel that little rush when you guess it right! 😄

Let’s keep learning and building. 🚀
